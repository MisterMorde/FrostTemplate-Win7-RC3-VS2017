/*
    Hello Everyone! This is a bot template i made B/c the one lunarlite made in CWS forum is shit and outdated!

    This one is updated to the latest version of 1.0: RC3! 
        

    use the Pre-Condition ===> [Command("Name")] To add a name to a command! Remember that this Pre-Condition will not trigger unless you have your prefix before the said command! 
    (Prefix in CommandHandler.cs , Line 58)

    Additional Pre-Attributes to Consider:

    [Remarks("Summary")] ===> Adds a summary to your designated command. will not trigger anycode. just for human speak!
    [RequireOwner] ===> Requires the owner of the bot (YOU) to do the said command!
    [RequireUserPermissions(GuildPermission.Your Wanted Permission)] ===> Requires the user doing the command to have a specified guild permission!!!
    [RequireBotPermissions(GuildPermission.Your Wanted Permission)] ===> Requires the BOT to have a specified permission before operating the said command!
    

    Following a Pre-Condition , you must add a task! (Look at PublicModule.cs , Line 14 For example!)


    All Said operations will require the await Operator! (Look at PublicModule.cs , Line 16 for example!)


    That is all i have for you in this template! now its your turn to shine!

    If you need help , @ me in the CWS Discord or at my personal discord: https://discord.gg/jYrQd5d 



    ~Frost
